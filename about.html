    <h1>About "The Forest" Picture</h1>
    <p>
      This image was drawn digitally by me, on my iPad in a program called
      Procreate. I made up the name just now, first I went for "Forest", but
      then I thought putting "The" in front would make it sound more ominous. It
      was for a Game Design Program that I applied to, and the prompt was, "An
      adventurer is hiking alone when suddenly an enormous creature appears, and
      it is obvious the hiker is not welcome in its territory. The hiker
      prepares for a fight." Something along those lines. Therefore you were
      given a lot of creative freedom. It's the first big piece of art I've ever
      done with a whole background etc. Usually I settle for a face and that's
      it. So it was a fun, but demanding challenge. The thought process during
      the creation of it was that I wanted a strong female character being
      presented. And the overall vibe I was going for was definitely with Lord
      of the Rings, or Game of Thrones as a source of inspiration.
