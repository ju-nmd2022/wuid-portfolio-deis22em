        I'm 22 . I'm originally from a small city on the west coast called
        Uddevalla, but last year I moved to Skövde. From one small city to
        another, it was kind of a downgrade because Skövde doesn't have any
        ocean. However I plan on moving to
         next year. I've always described
        myself as creative and kind and I believe that to still be true. I love
        creating, whatever that may entail. From
        writing stories to drawing a character. I would also describe myself as
        quite spontaneous especially when it comes to doing stuff with friends
        for an example.

        I'm here mainly for the graphic design part of the program. I would say
        that's where my passion lies. But I know the other courses will be a
        great experience, not only for job opportunities, but also because it's
        good to know. Other than that my dream is to work with creating, and I
        think being a graphic designer can help me achieve that dream.
