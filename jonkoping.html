      <h3>Jönköping</h3>
      I want to start off by saying I don't live in Jönköping so I haven’t been
      able to experience it fully yet. However I do have some memories of it
      from when I was younger, when my dad used to work at one of the museums
      and me and my mom would come visit him during weekends. Like I mentioned
      in the previous assignment, I currently live in Skövde which is about 1
      hour away from Jönköping. I’ve also gone to meet friends from uni in the
      city. Therefore I’ve visited a couple of times and this is my take on
      Jönköping so far.

      <ul>
        <li>What can you do here?</li>
        I remember from my trips to Jönköping with my mom that we used to go to
        a bathhouse which had a pool with waves. (I’m guessing it is
        Rosenlundsbadet). That was very fascinating to me as a kid, even though
        I didn’t really know how to swim, but insisted I would go in there
        anyways. Making my mom come save me every time. It was fun. Now in my
        adolescence I mainly visit to hang out with friends or go shopping at
        A6. Jönköping is also the only city that has an IKEA close by, so
        whenever you need to go there Jönköping provides. Other than that I like
        to take walks and there are some nice parks; The City Park, The Town
        Hall Park, etc.

        <li>What are some good places to go out?</li>
        This is a question I cannot yet speak on. However if I were to find a
        place right now I’d like to try Bar Flamingo, according to Google it
        looks like they have some nice drinks. And for some themed bar vibes;
        Dirty Dicks Saloon. As the name suggests it’s a Western Themed
        restaurant/bar. I feel like it could be a hit or miss.

        <li>What are some good places to eat?</li>
        This question I do have a strong opinion on. STUK is an absolute winner.
        They have so much that is super good. Their pizzas are *chefs kiss* and
        overall it’s a very cozy café. Another café with very cozy vibes is
        Frimans. They have quite a big space, nice study area and a great menu.
