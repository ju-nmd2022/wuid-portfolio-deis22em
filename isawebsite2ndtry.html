        <h1>About Isa</h1>
        <p>
          I'm 22 . I'm originally from a small city on the west coast called
          Uddevalla, but last year I moved to Skövde. From one small city to
          another, it was kind of a downgrade because Skövde doesn't have any
          ocean. However I plan on moving to
          <a href="jonkoping.html">Jönköping</a> next year. I've always
          described myself as creative and kind and I believe that to still be
          true. I love creating, whatever that may entail. From writing stories
          to drawing a character. I would also describe myself as quite
          spontaneous especially when it comes to doing stuff with friends for
          an example.

        <h3>Why do I study NMD?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm here mainly for the graphic design part of the program. I would
          say that's where my passion lies. But I know the other courses will be
          a great experience, not only for job opportunities, but also because
          it's good to know. Other than that my dream is to work with creating,
          and I think being a graphic designer can help me achieve that dream.
